# Benchmark
A quick-and-dirty benchmark of Servente, using [plow](https://github.com/six-ddc/plow).
Note that these results are not representative of real-world performance, and
are not to be used for any kind of comparison.

The benchmark was run on Manjaro Linux (kernel 5.10.161-1-MANJARO), AMD Ryzen 5 2400G
and 32 GB of RAM.

## Reproducing
To reproduce these results, run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/usadson/servente.git
cd servente
cargo build --release
mkdir wwwroot
echo "Hello, world!" > wwwroot/test.txt
cargo run --release
```

In another terminal, run the following commands:
```bash
go install github.com/six-ddc/plow@latest
~/go/bin/plow -k https://localhost:8080/test.txt -c500 -n 1000000 -d 30s
```

## Results
