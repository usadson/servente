## Building
Servente is built using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a modern systems
programming language. It can be built using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/),
Rust's package manager and build tool.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/usadson/servente.git
cd servente

# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

## Running
Servente can be run using the `servente` binary, which can be found in the
`target/release` directory after building.

```bash
# Run the server
./target/release/servente
```

## Configuring
Servente automatically creates a self-signed certificate and key for HTTPS. They
can be overriding by placing the `cert.der` and `key.der` files in the `.servente`
directory in current working directory.

Files are served from the `wwwroot/` directory in the current working directory.
You can override the welcome page by placing a `index.html` file in the `wwwroot/`.
